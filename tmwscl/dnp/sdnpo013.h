   *     control is being forwarded to a downwstream device that is reporting Local.
   *    DNPDEFS_CROB_ST_ALR_COMPLETE - the request was not accepted because the 
   *     operation is already complete. For example if the request is to close a 
   *     switch and the switch is already closed.
   *    DNPDEFS_CROB_ST_BLOCKED - the request was not accepted because is specifically
   *     blocked at the outstation.
   *    DNPDEFS_CROB_ST_CANCELLED - the request was not accepted because the operation
   *     was cancelled.

   *     control is being forwarded to a downwstream device which cannot be reached or
