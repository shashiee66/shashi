   * arguments:
   *  pSession - pointer to session
   *  point - point number of point that generated the event
   *  pValue - pointer to commanded value for this analog output point
   *  status - status from processing the command. 
   *    DNPDEFS_CTLSTAT_SUCCESS - the command was performed successfully
   *    DNPDEFS_CTLSTAT_FORMAT_ERROR - The request was not accepted due
   *      to formatting errors in the request. This value may also be use
   *      to indicate that the value in the request exceeds the permitted
   *      level (see Table 4-2 in DNP3 Specification Volume 2, Application
   *      Layer.)

   *      (i.e., an Operate message was sent to activate a control point
   *      that was not previously armed with a Select message.)
   *    DNPDEFS_CTLSTAT_FORMAT_ERROR - the request was not accepted due
   *      to formatting errors in the request
   *    DNPDEFS_CTLSTAT_NOT_SUPPORTED - the request was not accepted because
   *      Control operations are not supported for this point

   *      the control queue is full or the point is already active

   *      Local/Remote switch is in Local Position
   *    DNPDEFS_CTLSTAT_NOT_AUTHORIZED - the request was not accepted because 
   *      of insufficient authorization.
   *    DNPDEFS_CTLSTAT_AUTO_INHIBIT - the request was not accepted because it
   *      was prevented or inhibited by a local automation process  
   *    DNPDEFS_CTLSTAT_PROC_LIMITED - the request was not accepted because the
   *     device cannot process any more activities than are presently in progress 
   *    DNPDEFS_CTLSTAT_OUT_OF_RANGE - the request was not accepted because the 
   *     value is outside the acceptable range permitted for this point.  
   *    DNPDEFS_CTLSTAT_DOWNSTRM_LOCAL - the request was not accepted because the 
   *     control is being forwarded to a downwstream device that is reporting Local.
   *    DNPDEFS_CTLSTAT_ALR_COMPLETE - the request was not accepted because the 
   *     operation is already complete. For example if the request is to close a 
   *     switch and the switch is already closed.
   *    DNPDEFS_CTLSTAT_BLOCKED - the request was not accepted because is specifically
   *     blocked at the outstation.
   *    DNPDEFS_CTLSTAT_CANCELLED - the request was not accepted because the operation
   *     was cancelled.
   *    DNPDEFS_CTLSTAT_BLOCKED_OM - the request was not accepted because another 
   *     master has exclusive rights to operate this point.
   *    DNPDEFS_CTLSTAT_DOWNSTRM_FAIL -  the request was not accepted because the 
   *     control is being forwarded to a downwstream device which cannot be reached or
   *     is otherwise incapable of performing the request.
   *    DNPDEFS_CTLSTAT_UNDEFINED - the request not accepted because of some 
   *     other undefined reason
